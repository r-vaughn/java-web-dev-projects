// 1. The menu consists of several menu items.
//
//      spaghetti, alfredo, NEW
//
// 2. Each menu item has a price, description, and category (appetizer, main course, or dessert)
// 3. It should be possible to display whether a menu item is new or not.
// 4. The app should know when the menu was last updated, so visitors can see that the
//    restaurant is constantly changing and adding exciting new items.

// TIP: You may find it useful to use one or more of the classes provided by Java, such as Date

// Idea: Meal bundles - pick three for $## - one appetizer, one entr√©e/main course, one dessert
// several choices for each - standards + one daily "special" to choose from

// Menu should have appetizers, main course, dessert
// Each MenuItem should have: Category, Title, Description, and a price.
